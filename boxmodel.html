       <p> A rainbow is a beautiful, natural phenomenon that occurs when sunlight interacts with water droplets in the air. When
        sunlight passes through the droplets, it bends (refracts), splits into different colors (disperses), and reflects off
        the inside of the droplet. As the light exits the droplet, it refracts again, creating a spectrum of colors that appear
        as a rainbow.</p>
        <p>The colors of a rainbow always appear in the same order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, often
        remembered by the acronym ROYGBIV. The rainbow is typically visible when the sun is behind you, and rain or mist is in
        front of you. Each color is caused by the different wavelengths of light, with red having the longest wavelength and
        violet the shortest.</p>
        <p> Rainbows symbolize beauty, hope, and wonder, making them one of nature's most enchanting displays.</p>
